# Curriculum Mapping and UI Test Report

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ All Tests PASSED

## 1. Curriculum File Mappings

| Subject | File Name | Status | Topics Found |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Mathematics | `curriculum/mathematics_curriculum.json` | ✅ Exists | ~100+ topics |
| Science | `curriculum/science_curriculum.json` | ✅ Exists | ~100+ topics |
| English | `curriculum/english_curriculum.json` | ✅ Exists | ~80+ topics |
| History | `curriculum/history_curriculum.json` | ✅ Exists | ~90+ topics |
| Geography | `curriculum/geography_curriculum.json` | ✅ Exists | ~85+ topics |
| Economics | `curriculum/economics_curriculum.json` | ✅ Exists | ~75+ topics |

**Result: 6/6 subjects have valid curriculum files**

## 2. UI Subject Card Consistency

The UI displays exactly 6 subject cards in `TutorScreen.kt`:

1. **Mathematics** - Maps to `mathematics_curriculum.json` ✅
2. **Science** - Maps to `science_curriculum.json` ✅
3. **English** - Maps to `english_curriculum.json` ✅
4. **History** - Maps to `history_curriculum.json` ✅
5. **Geography** - Maps to `geography_curriculum.json` ✅
6. **Economics** - Maps to `economics_curriculum.json` ✅

**Result: All UI subjects have proper curriculum mappings**

## 3. Topic Parsing Verification

The `parseTopicForFloatingBubbles()` function successfully breaks down complex topics:

### Examples:
- **Original:** "Production, trade & interdependence"
- **Parsed:** ["Production", "trade", "interdependence"]

- **Original:** "Numbers: Natural numbers, integers, rational numbers"  
- **Parsed:** ["Numbers", "Natural numbers", "integers", "rational numbers"]

- **Original:** "Forces and Motion (velocity, acceleration)"
- **Parsed:** ["Forces and Motion", "velocity", "acceleration"]

**Result: Topic parsing works correctly for floating bubbles**

## 4. Grade-Specific Enhancements

### Grade 6 Improvements Implemented:
- **Word Limit:** Increased from 50 to 80 words
- **Token Limit:** Increased from 200 to 320 tokens  
- **Topic Variety:** Enhanced from 8 to 10 topics
- **Special Instructions:** Added transitional learning prompts

### All Grade Levels (K-12):
- **Topic Simplification:** Applied to all grades for better comprehension
- **Progressive Complexity:** Token and word limits scale appropriately by grade
- **Curriculum Coverage:** All 6 subjects supported across all grade levels

## 5. Memory Leak Resolution

✅ **Fixed:** TextToSpeechManager memory leak
- Moved from direct instantiation to Hilt dependency injection
- Added ProcessLifecycleOwner for proper cleanup
- Used @ApplicationContext to avoid Activity context references

## 6. System Architecture Validation

### Dependency Injection:
- ✅ Hilt properly configured for all components
- ✅ TextToSpeechManager as @Singleton
- ✅ Repository pattern implemented

### File Structure:
- ✅ All curriculum JSON files present in assets/curriculum/
- ✅ Proper JSON structure with PYP/MYP/DP programs
- ✅ Grade-appropriate topic organization

### UI Components:
- ✅ 6 subject cards display correctly
- ✅ Floating bubbles work for all subjects
- ✅ Topic selection and parsing functional

## Overall Assessment: ✅ SYSTEM FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**All curriculum mappings are correct, UI displays all subjects properly, topic parsing works as expected, and the memory leak has been resolved. The system is ready for production use with enhanced grade 6 capabilities.**

### Key Achievements:
1. **Complete Subject Coverage** - All 6 subjects (Math, Science, English, History, Geography, Economics) fully supported
2. **Floating Bubbles Fixed** - Now works for all subjects, not just Science
3. **Grade 6 Enhanced** - Improved response quality with better token/word allocation
4. **Memory Leak Resolved** - TextToSpeechManager properly managed through dependency injection
5. **Topic Simplification** - Applied across all grades for better AI explanations
6. **Production Ready** - All systems tested and validated
